# This file allows you to define the business rules the aggregator will use when determining which services are called for
# the request.
#
# You specify which data object, which data element, and the values (value coming in on the left and the translation 
# on the right)
#
# This and all other YAML files in the ./config directory will be reloaded by the Delivery Aggregator as soon as you save your
# changes. This means that once you add a service here, it will be available to the next incoming request (The Aggregator will
# not dispatch to the new service(s) though until after you add it them to the rules.yaml)
#
# Because the system will auto reload this file make sure that there are no <tab> characters before you save. Tab characters
# break the YAML parser and will cause the Aggregator to shutdown!

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# In this section you define services that should be called every time a request is received. 
#
# These services will skip the logic check in the next section but will adhere to the minimum_item_groups in the last section. 
# For example if you place the cover_thing service into this section it will be dispatched regardless of the genre and 
# content_type of the citation but if the citation has no isbn it will still be placed in the holding queue.
#
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dispatch_always:
  - default              # Delete this one ONLY if youo no longer have a need for the default service which returns stub data
  - consortial
  - oclc_xid
  - worldcat_discovery
  - sfx

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# In this section you categorize services into groups that are then tied to specific data elements values.
#
# For example:
#    given the following configuration:
#
#        objects:
#          citation:
#            genre:
#              journal:
#                - sfx
#                - pubmed
#                - cover_open_library
#              book:
#                - sfx
#                - cover_thing
#            content_type:
#              full_text:
#                - sfx
#                - cover_open_library
#                - cover_thing
#
#     Then if an openUrl request came in with the following ?rft.genre=journal&rft.content=full_text the system would
#     dispatch sfx and cover_open_library. It would not call pubmed because pubmed does not support full_text (in this example!)
#     and it would not call cover_thing because that service does not support the journal genre.
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
objects:
  citation:
    # Group services into the genres they can search
    # When a citation comes in from a client the rules engine will use this list to determine what
    # services the broker will dispatch. For example the cover_open_library service can only provide
    # results for books so it should only appear in the book and bookitem genre types
    genre:
      journal:
        - internet_archive
      book:
        - internet_archive
        - cover_thing
      bookitem:
        - internet_archive
        - cover_thing

    # Group services into the type of content they can provide
    # When a citation comes in from a client the rules engine will use this list to determine what
    # services the broker will dispatch. For example the internet_archive service can only provide
    # results for electronic and audio copies of an item so it should NOT be found in the holdings
    # category!
    content_type:
      electronic:
        - internet_archive
        - cover_thing
      full_text:
        - internet_archive
        - cover_thing
      holdings:
        - cover_thing
      audio:
        - internet_archive

# In this section you categorize services into groups that are then tied to specific data elements values.
#
# Define the minimum amount of citation information required to process a service. The options MUST match attributes on the Citation object!
# Items within an array indicate an OR relationship and items on different lines indicate an AND relationship so:
#
#    some_journal:
#      - 'article_title'
#      - ['title', 'journal_title']
#
#   Translates to:  citation includes -> an Article Title AND (a Title OR a Journal Title)
#
# You may also use the names of children to have the system verify that the citation has at least one child
#
#    internet_archive:
#      - ['title', 'book_title']
#      - ['authors']
#
#   Translates to: citation includes -> (a Title OR book_title) AND at least 1 author
